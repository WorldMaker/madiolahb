Libraries and specs for facillitating the [Bhaloidam](http://bhaloidam.com) RPG

## History

Madiolahb started as the "HCE Bee", a Wave/XMPP bot for an early pre-release of Bhaloidam when it was still
known as the "HoneyComb Engine" (thus the original bot name). With the death of Wave and the final release of
Bhaloidam the concept was to retool to be an even more platform agnostic facillitation library with a focus
on a well defined object format (as JSON specifications) and to catch up to the final Bhaloidam rules.
