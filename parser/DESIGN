This is a simple TODO list for the HCE Bee's "language", and should
serve as a useful collection of examples.

Setup
=====

IM Only Commands: 
  Because IM conversations do not have IDs/subject lines that can be used
  to determine the game in progress... The restriction will likely be that
  only one game can be active at any time for a storyteller.

  [This is called <Game Name>.]
  [This continues <Game Name>.]
  [This ends <Game Name>.]

* Chaining these in useful ways will be important.

[<id> is playing (as <Char Name>) with X will and Y ego.]
[I am...]

[He/She/It/<Char Name> has X <Element> (strength).]
[I have...]

[She has advanced X (points/tokens) in profession Y.]
[She has advanced X (points/tokens) in her third profession.]
[I have...]

[<id> is playing as <Char Name> with X ego, Y life strength, Z water,
and A will. It has advanced X in profession 1, Y in its second 
profession, and Z in profession 3.]

Game Flow
=========

* Ticks should be automatically announced.

[(I) flow/exert X to <influence>.]
[(I) (hero(ically)) challenge/contest <Char Name> with/in <influence>.
(under <profession>).]

Uncontested version:

[(I) (hero(ically)) act(ion) with/in <influence> (under <profession>).]

[(I) (re)set (<Char Name>/myself) (to <time>).]
[(I) lose X (ego).]

Hex Map
=======
[(I) am at X, Y.] Set-Up/Teleport

[(I) move (<Char Name>/myself) <direction> X (spots/spaces).]

Renown
======

[<Char Name> deserves X for <influence>.]
[(I) assent/aye.]
[(I) dissent/nay.]
