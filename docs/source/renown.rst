======
Renown
======

**[**\ I nominate *Character name* for *Count* *Element* renown.\ **]**
Sometimes a character just deserves her due "props" for good
storytelling.

Other players are then encouraged to vote upon the renown nomination.

(For the renown and voting verbs, the subject is largely ignored.)

======
Voting
======

**[**\ I assent.\ **]** or **[**\ Aye.\ **]** versus **[**\ I dissent.
**]** or **[**\ Nay.\ **]**. The Bee will keep track of responses and
attempt to meter a majority.

Forcing the vote
================

A player, presumably the storyteller prime, can finish a stalled vote
with **[**\ I acclimate.\ **]**.
