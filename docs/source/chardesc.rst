Describing Characters
=====================

Generally the first thing to do in a game will be to describe the
characters currently being played. These commands can (and may) be used
at any point in a game, but will often be primarily associated with
beginning a new game.

A note on terminology: the Bee refers to the objects that it manipulates
as characters and this documentation will refer to them as such, but
they don't necessarily have to be "characters". In HCE terms, anywhere
you see the word character you may mentally replace it with "thing with
a LifeWheel".

Creating a Character
====================

A character needs to be created before it can be played. **[**\
*Address* is playing *Character Name*.\ **]** where *Address* is the
player (IM address, email address, or Wave address) that will own (play)
that character. Keep in mind the character naming rules, and this
command will be your first and best place to learn if the Bee has any
problems with the name you chose.

  | **[**\ jim@example.com is playing Tommy Jones.\ **]**
  | **[**\ I am playing Barnaby.\ **]**

This command is a rare exception to normal Pronoun handling: Because
this command deals specifically with a player rather than a character,
the Pronoun here represents "the current player". This command
automatically sets "the current character" to the newly created
character, for pronouns in subsequent commands.
