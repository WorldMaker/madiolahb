Acting

The key part of a character's turn involves deciding upon an influence,
a type of action, exerting any will necessary for the action, and if
necessary rolling to determine the Fate of the action.

Exerting Will
=============

A character can exert will, moving will from the source to the
influence, by **[**\ I exert *Number* to *Influence*.\ **]**. Multiple
"count to influences" can be chained in a single sentence, with optional
comma and/or "and", should this be needed.

The word "flow" can also be substituted as a synonym of "exert".

  **[**\ I exert 2 to poise.\ **]**

Starting an action
==================

The choices to be made in setting up an action:

* The influence in question

* Contested versus uncontested --- This is represented by the verb
  choice: "contest" or "challenge" versus "act"

* Heroic versus mundane --- The words "hero", "heroic", or "heroically"
  can be used as an adverb to signal a heroic action, whereas mundane is
  the default

* For a contested action a character needs to be chosen to be challenged

* Whether an action qualifies as a professional action --- An "under
  clause" can be appended to choose a profession: **[**\ ...under
  profession *Number*.\ **]** or **[**\ ...under my *Cardinal number*
  profession.\ **]**

Thus the four major forms of the action command:

  | **[**\ I act with *Influence*.\ **]**
  | **[**\ I heroically act with *Influence*.\ **]**
  | **[**\ I challenge *Character name* with *Influence*.\ **]**
  | **[**\ I challenge *Character name* heroically with *Influence*.\
    **]**

An example:

  **[**\ I heroically contest The Bear with charm under my first
  profession.\ **]**

Based upon this information, and will exerted, the Bee will determine if
a roll needs to be made and if so will report the roll's success.
